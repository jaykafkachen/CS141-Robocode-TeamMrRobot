# CS141-Robocode-TeamMrRobot

Robot Concept: Attacks the lowest health bot while avoiding the ones with high health. Uses risk based movement to determine when to move and to avoid walls/bots. An attempt to throw off prediction based trackers was made in that the robot will not move until hit, as it is in a "safe space" until then.
